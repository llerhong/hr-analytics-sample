# HR Trend Analysis
This project aims to analyse a sample employee database to uncover trends in employee demographics, salary, and hiring trends. It involves preprocessing and creating an appropriate data model from MySQL's [Employees Sample Database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/), which is then used for data visualisation and report generation to derive insights on the aforementioned topics. Further documentation regarding data preprocessing and analysis can be found in the [SQL script](query.sql) and [PDF report](docs.pdf) respectively.

# Tools Used
- **MySQL**: Data validation & preprocessing in SQL
- **Power BI**: Data modeling & report generation, DAX for custom aggregations

# Dataset
- [MySQL Employees Sample Database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/)
